        Every project is associated with an icon. This icon is displayed in every
        list your project appears in.
    </p>

    <h2>Default icons</h2>

    <p>
        The default icon for your project is generated as an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon" target="_blank">identicon</a> by the online avatar
        service <a href="http://gravatar.com" target="_blank">gravatar.com</a> (which is also used to fetch the
        <a href="/help/user-icons">user-icons</a>). The project title is included in this
        generation process, so changing your project title might also change your
        default icon.
    </p>

    <h2>Upload a custom icon</h2>

    <p>
        {{ helpImageStatic('about/img/project-sidebar.png', 'The project page sidebar.') }}

        It is possible to upload a custom icon for your project. You will find a
        link for this in your project page sidebar.
    </p>

    <p>
        You will find a form displaying your current icon. On the right you
        are able to select an image file from your computer. This file
        must meet the following guidelines in order to be a valid icon.
        Otherwise the upload will fail.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Icons have to be in <b>PNG</b>, <b>JPG</b> or <b>GIF</b> format.</li>
        <li>Icons should be at least 128 x 128 pixels in size, but may not exceed 512 x 512 pixels.</li>
        <li>If your icon is too small, it will be scaled up. This will reduce its quality.</li>
        <li>Your icon may be max. 250 KB in size. If you cannot fit this, choose another size or compression. We suggest PNG.</li>
        <li>Your icon must meet the <a href="/about/content-guidelines">content guidelines.</a></li>
        <li>You have to own the right to publish the icon without violating any copyright.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips for a good icon</h2>

    <p>
        It can be difficult to find a good icon for your project. You always
        need to keep in mind that this is what other users see first, and
        that they recognize your project by its icon. So follow these
        few steps:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Don't use a complicated icon.</b>
            In some lists the icon will be scaled down to 16x16 pixels. If your
            icon is too complicated, one cannot identify it well.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Have contrast.</b>
            Your icon will be better recognizale with a high contrast against
            its background.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Capture the main characteristic of your project. </b>
            Otherwise one might not remember what your project was about
            when seeing the icon.
        </li>
    </ol>
