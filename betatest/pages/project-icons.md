# Project icons

Every project is associated with an icon. This icon is displayed in every
list your project appears in.

## Default icons

The default icon for your project is generated as an
[identicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) by the online avatar
service [gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com) (which is also used to fetch the
[user-icons](/help/user-icons)\). The project title is included in this
generation process, so changing your project title might also change your
default icon.

## Upload a custom icon

It is possible to upload a custom icon for your project. You will find a
